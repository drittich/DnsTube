#### *"Access your home computer from anywhere"*

## DnsTube
A Windows client for dynamically updating Cloudflare DNS entries with your public IP address.

## What is this?

Most of us have home computers with dynamically assigned IP addresses provided by our ISPs. If you want to serve up a web site, be able to access files remotely, or use RDP, etc., from the internet, it becomes challenging to locate your machine when the IP address is constantly changing. This is the problem DNS was designed to solve, so by getting a domain name and updating the DNS entries for it as-needed, you can always access your computer by its domain name, and forget about IP addresses.

This is where DnsTube comes in. Cloudflare provides free DNS hosting for your domain, and also provides an API for updating DNS entries, i.e., the IP address in this case. By running DnsTube on your computer, it will periodically check the public-facing IP address and update the Cloudflare DNS entry as needed.

## Features

* Can update A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), SPF, and TXT records.
* Support both Cloudflare API keys and tokens
* Supports API tokens scoped to specific zones
* Runs as a Windows service, so login not required

## Downloading 

Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/drittich/DnsTube/releases/latest) page to download the latest binary.

## Installing

- Extract the package to a folder of your choice
- Open a command prompt as Administrator and install the service using  `install-service.bat`.
You should see the following output:
```
PS C:\Program Files\DnsTubeService> .\install-service.bat
sc create "DnsTube Service" binPath="C:\Program Files\DnsTubeService\DnsTube.Service.exe" start=auto
[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
[SC] ChangeServiceConfig2 SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: DnsTube Service
		TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
		STATE              : 2  START_PENDING
								(NOT_STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
		WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
		SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
		CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
		WAIT_HINT          : 0x7d0
		PID                : 21408
		FLAGS              :
PS C:\Program Files\DnsTubeService>
```

## Configuration

By default the service hosts the web application on your local machine at port 5666. If you wish to change this, edit appsettings.json accordingly. Once the service is running you can launch the interface at http://localhost:5666/ (or whatever port you have chosen).

If you haven't already done so, you will need to create an account with Cloudflare and make it the DNS authority for your domain. You then need to configure your DNS entries as appropriate. See [Managing DNS records in Cloudflare](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019093151-Managing-DNS-records-in-Cloudflare) for more info.

After that, you'll need to generate an API Token (preferred) or Key in order to access the API via DnsTube. The details for doing that can be found at [Creating API tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/tokens/create).

Then, go the DsnTube settings page and enter your email address, API key/token, etc. Go back to the main tab (refresh if necessary) and you should see a table listing your Cloudflare DNS entries. Check off the ones you want to dynamically update and the service should take it from there.

You can use [nslookup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/nslookup) to make sure DNS resolution is working correctly, e.g., 
```
nslookup mydomain.com
```

## Updating

- Download the latest release from https://github.com/drittich/DnsTube/releases/latest and uncompress
- Open a command prompt as Administrator and stop the existing service by running `stop-service.bat` 
- Copy the new uncompressed files over the existing ones. The configuration is stored elsewhere so will be preserved.
- Start the service again by running `start-service.bat` 

## Uninstalling
Open a command prompt as Administrator and uninstall the service using  `uninstall-service.bat`. You should see the following output:
```
PS C:\Program Files\DnsTubeService> .\uninstall-service.bat

SERVICE_NAME: DnsTube Service
		TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
		STATE              : 3  STOP_PENDING
								(STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)
		WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
		SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
		CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
		WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
[SC] DeleteService SUCCESS
PS C:\Program Files\DnsTubeService>
```

## Notes

1. DnsTube only updates existing Cloudflare records. It will not create or remove records.

## Development

The front-end application must be built before starting the .NET application. To do this, open a command prompt and go to `[YOUR_INSTALL_FOLDER]\DnsTube.Service\ClientApp`. Then run
```
npm install
npm run build
```

This will build your files and copy them to the `[YOUR_INSTALL_FOLDER]\DnsTube.Service\wwwroot` folder.

At this point you can load the solution in Visual Studio 2022 and run the application with `Ctrl - F5`. You should then be able to load the application UI at the URL http://localhost:5666.


## The Name

We all know the internet is a [series of tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes). This application uses those very same tubes to update your DNS.
